    <h1><em>About My Learning:</em></h1>
      <p>I have found this process very challenging becauses i felt like I could not
        keep up with the rest of the class. That is also one of the reasons why
        i try and put in as much time to practice in class and at home.</p>
        <p>I have learnt how to do paragrahs,how to insert an img,how to create
           a table and nesting tables, which i found extremly challenging!</p>
           <p>I have also learnt more about myself and became more self-aware.
             This whole experiance has taught me that it is fine to not know
             how to do certain things but to understand how to do the things I
             know. They teaching us how to teach ourselves because in the real
             world, there is not always going to be people around to help or
             assist me. In such cases I have to help myself to overcome a certain
             problem that I am Facing.</p>
